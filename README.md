# 🌍 Climate Change Modeling

Welcome to the *Climate Change Modeling* project — an open-source initiative to simulate, analyze, and forecast climate dynamics using scientific models and computational tools.

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to model the impacts of climate change using a combination of physical simulation, statistical methods, and machine learning. It focuses on understanding the interactions between atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial systems to forecast future climate scenarios under various emission pathways.

## 🔬 Key Features

- 🌡️ Temperature and precipitation trend modeling
- 🌀 Atmospheric and oceanic circulation simulation
- 🌱 Land use and carbon cycle integration
- 🤖 Machine learning-based scenario forecasting
- 📊 Visualization tools for output data

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy / SciPy / Pandas
- NetCDF4 / xarray
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for ML-based models)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly
- GIS Tools (optional: QGIS, GeoPandas)

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
